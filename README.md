# The WP Community Collective Archives

This repository serves as the central index of archived materials and records for The WP Community Collective. It links to dedicated archival repositories for finalized or sunsetted programs, board decisions, financial records, and meeting notes.

These materials are preserved for transparency, legal requirements, reference, and long-term institutional memory.
